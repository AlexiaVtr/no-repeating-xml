# Welcome to the no-repeating-xml repository!

This repository contains a JavaScript script that prevents global components from being duplicated in WebSphere when adding new libraries. 
The application replaces .xml names by adding a number to the end to avoid conflicts.

To run the application, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system.

To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the directory where the application is located and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

To start the application, run the following command:
```
npm start
```
The application will prompt you to enter the path to the directory containing the .xml files that you want to rename.
Once you have entered the path, the application will automatically rename the .xml files according to the specified format.

We hope you find this application helpful in managing your WebSphere global components!
